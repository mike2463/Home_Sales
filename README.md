# Home_Sales

* In Pyspark, I read in the Home Sales data and created a dataframe. Using that data frame I performed several queries to look average price, average price by the number of rooms, and average prive per sqaure foot. I also wrote and read the data to and from parquet and partioned on it on a key. Though there is not a lot analysis with this particular project, it was more about using Pyspark and parquet and getting familiar with them.
